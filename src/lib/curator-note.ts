/**
 * Splitting a curator note into its three moves.
 *
 * Every note in the catalogue follows the same shape, and the data test
 * enforces it: a note says **when** the tool is the right one, **what it
 * replaces**, and what the **caveat** is. That is the whole editorial voice
 * of the site, and it is currently rendered as one grey paragraph — a reader
 * has to parse three separate claims out of a block of prose.
 *
 * This module pulls the three moves apart so the interface can show them as
 * three labelled lines. The note's exact wording is never changed: the
 * segments are the original sentences, only separated.
 *
 * The two languages mark the moves differently.
 *
 *  - English opens each move with a word: "When …", "Replaces …", "Caveat:".
 *    Splitting on those words is reliable, including when a sentence contains
 *    a full stop inside quotation marks.
 *  - Chinese has no such opening word for the first move — 时 appears in the
 *    middle of the sentence ("……的空提示时，我从这里起手"). The moves are
 *    separated by the sentence mark, and the second and third are found by
 *    the words they contain (替代 and 注意).
 *
 * The parser is deliberately forgiving. A note that does not split cleanly
 * falls back to showing the whole text as one line, so a future note with a
 * different shape still renders something honest rather than dropping text.
