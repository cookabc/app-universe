/**
 * A generated plan: one committed tool per workflow stage.
 *
 * The explorer's seed only shuffles browsing order — it never decides. A plan
 * is the step past that: five picks that a visitor can take away as-is. The
 * picks are not drawn independently. One anchor tool is drawn from the seed
 * first, and every stage then prefers candidates that share tags with it, so
 * a plan keeps a direction instead of reading like five strangers.
 *
 * Identity is fully deterministic: (seed, picks) reproduces the plan byte for
 * byte, which is what makes it shareable. The anchor always comes from the
 * seed alone — rerolling one step never re-anchors the others, so swapping a
 * tool out cannot quietly bend the rest of the plan.
